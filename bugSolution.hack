This is the original buggy code with no solution for the overflow.

To solve the issue of integer overflow, a solution is needed. However, Hack does not have built-in arbitrary-precision integers.  One solution could be to use a library or custom implementation that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic.  Or add checks to the code that would detect when an integer overflow occurs and handle the error condition accordingly. 

However, simply switching to a different type won't work without an appropriate library or large integer support in the language.  In Hack,  the integer type's size is often platform-dependent.

The focus here is to highlight the unexpected integer overflow scenario and the need for careful consideration of data types in arithmetic operations.
